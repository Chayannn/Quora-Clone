        question="How has your life changed after one incident which you were always afraid of?"
        message="Thank you for A2A.

        I was doing my B.tech.. I used to live in Jaipur, away from my family. I belong to a middle class family. Moved to a city from a small town with big aspirations but after seeing failure at IIT JEE, I had lost all hopes in myself. I was a topper in my school but during college, things changed. I was always spending time talkinâ€™ on phone and having timepas in hostel and study during semester exams only to pass the exams.
        
        My father took an educational loan for my studies, but I didn't care, because I was so hopeless. I considered myself a waste already. But it was 3rd year which changed my life. My father lost his job. He told me he has no money to continue with my college expenses, and I might drop out. That incident changed me completely. I was so scared to drop out of college after coming halfway, I started studying properly. I managed to get few tuitions to manage my expenses. It was one year to prepare for college placements. I used to get up at 4 am and no fix time for sleeping. College, then taking tuitions, then studies (all 3 years course at once because I never studied before), and internship. But hard work pays off. I cracked the interviews and got placed in two biggies - Infosys and Cognizant, got interview calls from many.
        
        I was always scared of my family end up being poor but it changed me to a capable daughter :)"
